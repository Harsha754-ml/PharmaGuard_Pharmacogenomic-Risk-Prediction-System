# PharmaGuard: Pharmacogenomic Risk Prediction System

## Project Overview
PharmaGuard is an innovative software solution designed to assist healthcare professionals in assessing the pharmacogenomic risk of patients. By analyzing genetic data, the system provides recommendations on medication choices and dosages that align with the unique genetic profiles of patients, aiming to enhance therapeutic efficacy and minimize adverse drug reactions.

## Features
- **Pharmacogenomic Analysis:** Evaluate genetic variants affecting drug metabolism and response.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive design for easy navigation and data entry.
- **Custom Reports:** Generate detailed reports highlighting genetic risks and recommended actions.
- **Data Security:** Ensures patient data confidentiality and complies with healthcare regulations.
- **Integration Ready:** Can be integrated with existing healthcare systems for seamless data exchange.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Harsha754-ml/PharmaGuard_Pharmacogenomic-Risk-Prediction-System.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd PharmaGuard_Pharmacogenomic-Risk-Prediction-System
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Usage
- Upon launching, the user will be greeted with a dashboard where they can input patient data.
- After data input, the system processes the information and provides insights based on the pharmacogenomic analysis.
- Users can generate reports to document the findings and recommendations.

## Architecture
The system is designed using a modular architecture consisting of:
- **Frontend:** Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a responsive interface.
- **Backend:** Developed using Python, with Flask as the framework to handle requests and processes.
- **Database:** Uses SQL (e.g., SQLite or PostgreSQL) to store user data and analysis results.

## Technical Details
- **Language:** Python
- **Frameworks:** Flask for the backend; HTML/CSS and JavaScript for the frontend.
- **Database Management System:** SQLite/PostgreSQL
- **Dependencies:** A list of dependencies can be found in the `requirements.txt` file.
